Using rich media can turn a standard ad into a memorable experience. With MDX you can embed interactive components directly inside your content. That means buttons, forms, or custom animations are only a few lines away.

## Example

Below is a simple component that could serve as a call to action in an educational article. Try clicking the link to see how MDX allows interactivity right inside a blog post.

import HeaderLink from "../../components/HeaderLink.astro";

<HeaderLink href="#" onclick="alert('Thanks for clicking!')">

</HeaderLink>

MDX is a handy option when you want to mix straightforward writing with reusable design elements. It keeps your content pipeline flexible, letting you iterate on new advertising ideas without leaving Markdown behind.
